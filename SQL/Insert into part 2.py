Betel plants are raised for their leaves, which are most frequently used to flavour areca nut eating.","The leaf of the vine is the betel. It is referred to as paan in India. Tropical and subtropical regions are home to the perennial, evergreen climber known as betel vine. Some Asian emigrants mostly consume betel leaf in Asia and other parts of the world. Betel is now grown for both domestic and international trade. Sri Lanka, India, Thailand, and Bangladesh are the main nations that produce betel leaf.","A tropical environment with lots of rain is ideal for betel leaf development, and shaded locations are optimal for its ferocious growth. It thrives in regions with 225 to 475 cm of rainfall each year. A variety of soil types, including sandy loam and deep clayey loam, are suitable for growing betel leaf.","While areca nuts were once thought to be an aphrodisiac, betel leaves are used as a stimulant, an antibacterial, and a breath refresher.

The tall, fibrous stalk of celery tapers towards the leaves. Depending on the region and cultivar, people consume and cook with the stalks, leaves, or hypocotyl of this plant. As a spice, celery seed powder is employed.","The previous autumn, prepare the area where your celery will grow. Pick a location that receives plenty of sunlight and has wet soil. Steer clear of areas where the soil dries up quickly. To boost moisture retention, pull up any weeds and add a tonne of well-rotted manure or garden compost. Celery prefers rich, composted or well-rotted manure-enriched soil that has been improved. Because wild celery thrives in soggy soil, you will need to provide continuous watering for this demanding crop, and a sunny location should guarantee healthy, even growth.","Temperatures between 12°C and 16°C in the air and the soil are ideal for growth. For 10 to 15 hours, exposure to cold (2°C to 4°C) will start the blooming process. Even temperatures between 5°C and 10°C for 10 days will encourage the development of seed stalks. Celery transplant plants need to be cultivated in temperatures above 16°C.","In the Eastern culture, celery seed has been utilised as medicine for thousands of years. Celery seed was used in traditional Indian Ayurvedic medicine to treat conditions such as liver and spleen disorders, as well as colds, the flu, water retention, poor digestion, various forms of arthritis, and water retention.")')

It is sometimes referred to as bilimbi, cucumber tree, or tree sorrel. It is thought to have been indigenous to the Indonesian Maluku Islands, but it naturalised and is now widespread throughout Southeast Asia. Parts of tropical South Asia and the Americas are where it is grown. It produces eatable, very sour fruits. The carambola tree is a close cousin of this one.","Although Averrhoa bilimbi is said to have originated in the Indonesian island of Moluccas, the species is now farmed and may be found in Malaysia, Timor-Leste, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Maldives, and Indonesia. It is also typical in other Southeast Asian nations.","Grows natively in frost-free regions with annual lows of 17 °C to 25°C, yearly highs of 26°C to 35°C, annual rainfall of 1400 to 4500 mm, and a dry season of 5 months or less in moderately humid to humid subtropical and tropical lowland climates.","Due to its potent antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial capabilities, a bilimbi has antidiabetic, antihypertensive, antithrombotic, hypolipidemic, hepatoprotective, and wound healing benefits. It was shown to have considerable hypoglycemic and antioxidant properties that can be utilised to combat oxidative stress and its subsequent effects on heart disease, stroke, cancer, and liver damage.

It has a branching stem, long, narrow leaves that are grouped spirally, and it bears edible fruit. A tropical plant known as pandan, or Pandanus amaryllifolius, belongs to the Pandanus (screwpine) genus. It has aromatic leaves that are frequently used in Southeast Asian and South Asian dishes to add taste.","The majority of pandanus plants are found on low islands in the Polynesian and Micronesian archipelagos and dry atolls, however they may be found on many tropical and subtropical islands and coasts in the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans. The origin is hard to pinpoint due to a lengthy history of cultivation and transfer to several locations throughout the globe. Senegal, Benin, Tanzania, Madagascar, Réunion, the Maldives, and Mauritius are reported to cultivate it. Many tropical and subtropical areas, including Central America, the Caribbean, the United States (southern Florida, Puerto Rico), Brazil, India, and Indonesia, have received pandanus introductions.","In both the winter and the summer, the optimal temperature ranges are 75.2-82.4 °F. Peat, quartz, and coral sand make up the needed soil types. pH of the soil is 6 to 10. The optimum soil for pandanus growth is one that is rich, retains moisture, and drains well.","Traditional medicine values screwpine for its ability to relieve pain, particularly joint and arthritic discomfort. Researchers have discovered that oils derived from pandan extract are full of phytochemicals that are proven to ease arthritic symptoms. They also have the added benefit of relieving earaches and headaches. The leaves are made into a paste or poultice used against skin inflammations, including itchy skin and skin eruptions generally. A cough syrup is made from the fruit.")')
